	<LongDescription>
Enable advanced features for simulation speed.

By default, only 1x, 2x and 4x can be used.
AdvancedSimulationSpeed provides more options and more information.

## Usecases

- Speedup simulation for small city.
- View citizens in slow motion.
- Choose your preferred speed.
- Check actual simulation speed.

## Features

- Provide more simulation speed options like 0.25x or 8x.
- Multiple modes for selecting speed.
	- Double / Harf speed (Default)
	- Fixed step
	- Display Only
- Display selected speed and **actual** simulation speed.

## Limitation

The maximum speed is limited to 8x by the game code. Because of this limitation is hard-coded, it cannot be changed by MOD.
